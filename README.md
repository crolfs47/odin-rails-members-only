# odin-rails-members-only
## The Odin Project - Members Only

Build a website where users can register, login, and write blog posts. Only logged-in users can see who wrote a post.

## Languages/Technologies used:
 - Rails 
 - Ruby
 - Devise
 - SQLite3
 - VS Code
 - Git/Github
 - CSS - Bulma

## What I learned:
 - How to use Devise gem for registration and authentication
 - How to use Bulma framework for CSS
 - MVC - Model-View-Controller pattern
 - Generating models, database migrations, building forms, validations and error messages, model associations
 
## Still can improve:
 - This is still very basic, need to improve flow of website with a nav bar, etc.
 - Add ability to edit and delete posts
 - Improve user interface and CSS
