# odin-rails-members-only
## The Odin Project - Members Only

Build an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write anonymous posts. Inside the 
clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see 
the story and wonder who wrote it.


## Languages/Technologies used:
 - Rails 
 - Ruby
 - Devise
 - SQLite3
 - VS Code
 - Git/Github

## What I learned:
 - How to use Devise gem for authentication
 - MVC - Model-View-Controller pattern
 - Generating models, database migrations, building forms, validations and error messages, model associations
 
## Still can improve:
 - This is still very basic, need to improve flow of website and add CSS
 - Add ability to edit and delete posts
